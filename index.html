            <h4>Each unearthly ruler has been assigned a numerical value, much in the same manner as
          	each person on earth has an intrinsic value. Click a god to see their worth reflected in the current number. There will be math involved here, my children; but only because we know you are sufficiently strong to endure this 
          	plight.</h4>
            <h4>Aim to achieve an ever-higher score, up to and including the target number given you.</h4>
            <h4>But beware! You must reach the target number to win, but you may not go higher, or (not unlike a prophet who feels himself more spiritual than his acts reflect) ye shall be cast down into the pits of... well, losing a round. Not the worst fate, admittedly, but it isn't great, either.</h4>
            <h4>Each round the gods, fickle beings that they are, shall have a new value. And much like the "meaning of life"
          	varies from person to person, you shall have a new target number as well.</h4>
            <h2>GO FORTH! And math well, my children. Math well.</h2>
